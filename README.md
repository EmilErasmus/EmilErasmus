## Hi there! I am Emil Erasmus

## About me

I am a junior Software Developer currently focussing on Web Development. My passions lie in creating new things and collaborating on projects. 

âœ¨ I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the React framework.

ðŸŽ¸ Outside of the tech world I enjoy playing music (my instruments are guitar, drums and flute), working out and spending time in nature.

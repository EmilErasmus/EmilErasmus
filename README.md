# Hi there! I am Emil Erasmus

## About me

I am a junior software developer currently focusing on Web Development. My passions lie in learning new technologies and applying them to either new or on-going projects with a creative touch.

- âœ¨ I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and React. 

- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning PHP and CodeIgniter.

- ðŸŽ¸ Outside of the tech world I enjoy playing music, working out and spending time in nature.
